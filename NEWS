Version 1.0.5 [2017-10-17]
----------------------------

  o Corrected a minor error in the formulas for aic and bic in the dblm code.


Version 1.0.4 [2014-12-12]
----------------------------

  o New summary format for ldbglm objects. Two new functions have been defined:
    summary.ldbglm and print.summary.ldbglm

  o The use of "offset" now is allowed as an additional parameter in dbglm


Version 1.0.3 [2013-11-22]
----------------------------

  o Corrected maintainer's name format as instructed.
	
  o Function as.D2 now only changes the type of the input object and
    do not makes its squared version.

  o The character "_" has been eliminated of the package. It has been
    replaced by "." as is the case of: 

	- full_search -> full.search (dblm)
	- user_h -> user.h (ldblm and ldbglm)
	- scores_comps -> scores.comps (plot.dbplsr)
	- h_opt -> h.opt (ldblm and ldbglm)
	- ncomp_opt -> ncomp.opt (dbplsr)
	- type_var -> type.var (predict.dblm, predict.ldblm, predict.dbglm, 
	  predict.ldbglm, predict.dbplsr)
	- type_glm -> type.glm (plot.dbglm)

  o The name of the argument "method" in functions ldblm and ldbglm has been 
    changed by "method.h" when it refers to the bandwidth selection.

  o The name of the argument "type" in predict.dbglm and predict.ldbglm
    has been changed by "type.pred". The name the argument "type.glm" in plot.dblm
    has been changed by "type.pred". In both cases the name has been changed
    to unify the name of arguments refered to the same concept.

  o The argument "method" in function dbglm now includes five options: "Eff.rank", 
    "rel.gvar", "AIC", "BIC" and "GCV" instead of two (eff.rank and rel.gvar). 
    As a consequence in plot.dbglm it is possible to choose "which = 6" as in
    plot.dblm, to visualize the minimum achieved with the criterion specified in
    "method".

  o The summary command of function dbglm also prints the vale of the BIC and GCV
    crteria of the final DB-GLM.

  o The default value for "method" in function dbglm is now "GCV". The default 
    value for "full.search" in function dbglm is now "TRUE".

  o The argument "range.eff.rank" has been added in function dbglm.

  o The argument method.h of function ldbglm does not includes now the option 
    "OCV".

  o The value of function dbglm now includes too: call, dev.resids, varmu, 
    bic.model and gcv.model.

  o It has been applied when it has been necessary an estandarization of
    variables taking into account the original weights.

  o In the programming it has been changed: 
	- the name of "Llindar" by "threshold";
	- the value 9999999 by Inf.

  o Misprints have been modified in the help file and in the summary, print
    and plot commands. 


Version 1.0.2 [2012-05-18]
----------------------------

  o The calls of functions dblm, ldblm, dbglm and ldbglm have been unified 
    by eliminating .formula, .dist, .D2, .Gram of its names. The information 
    related to the different usages is now indicated by the arguments.


  o Misprints have been modified in the help file. 



Version 1.0.1 [2011-06-30]
----------------------------

  o First release on CRAN
